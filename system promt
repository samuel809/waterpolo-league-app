Create an app for the Dominican water polo league that tracks league matches, usually on Mondays and Wednesday, and water polo players stats during a match.
the app has to capture players stats and ranks them.

this ranking will be used to balance teams for the next match according to present players in order to divide the players into teams that are competitive.

ask all the questions needed in terms of rules, stats, gameplay, matches or anything necessary

depending on how many players are present at the start of each league match, sort players onto teams.

the best scenario is 7 players on each team, one goolie the rest field players, if there are less, use 6, 5 or 4 as necessary per team.

game rule is the first team to score 5 goals wins the game, best of 3 games win the match.

the winner plays next match with the rest available players balances based on their ranking.

that should have a simple interface for scorekeepers to enter the stats in real-time by someone not playing, with an iPad or cel phone. the stats have to be available online for the public to see.

Weighted system where certain stats are prioritized is preferred for the ranking system of the players.

no game clock as the winning team is the first to score 5 goals

the app should assign players for the next match based on registered players that are available on site. 

every match should be the best of 3 sets and each set, the first to score 5 goals.

as a measure to score, add a category for Unsportsmanlike behavior that takes points away for the player that does it, define Unsportsmanlike behavior as situations of excessive force, complaining to officials, bad words

consider Unsportsmanlike behavior for goalie. 

include keeping tracks for the official for the match.

the official of the match can change between matches.

the official should be evaluated and have a ranking score in order to keep track of the best official per season

season is 10 weeks.

the app should consider players registration before match and penalized those who register and are not available before start of the match in the ranking system.

the penalization should be on the score of the player over the season, not the team as teams are built upon available players for the day.

Penalty Types consider point deduction

must include player registration

official registration

public page with all stats per role, official, goalie, player, teams, season.

build everything needed for the app to be pushed to my GitHub repo.

ask any question needed to perform this.

players registration Will it be through the app or a website only

information required for player registration is name, age, email, phone, position, weight, height, t-shirt size and swimsuit size

matches can change week to week

the match has to begin and end with the team available players, during match they can enter the game after a goal only.

statistics should be tracked for each goals scored, assists, saves, fouls, and unsportsmanlike behavior.

unsportsmanlike behavior has to be recorded in points deduction per incident, and as well has be cumulative per player.

weight should be assigned to each statistic in the ranking system and goals scored are more important than assists. unsportsmanlike behavior is equally important in negative.

unsportsmanlike behavior impact player rankings varying based on severity.

for balancing teams use average ranking of players, separating goalies scores form field players. 

the app should allow for player preferences in team assignments, friends wanting to play together is permitted but has to be balanced out with the opposing team.

the information that is required for officials' registration is the same as players. 

preferred technology stack React Native for mobile, Node.js for backend

database system for storing data MongoDB

the specific features for the user interface are easy navigation and real-time updates

there are currently no apps for this

the minimum number of players required for a match is 4, one goalie and 3 field players

in the case thar there is only one goalie, the match should be played on one side of the pool, the same goalie for the two teams

User Roles users, admins and scorekeepers
Unsportsmanlike Behavior: only 3 levels should there be, and point deductions should be progressively 
Public Access: the public stats page will be fully open to registered users

Feedback Mechanism should be available for bugs and suggestions
